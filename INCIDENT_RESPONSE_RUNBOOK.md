# Incident Response Runbook

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a runbook for you, the AI agent, to follow in the event of a security incident. The goal of this runbook is to ensure that incidents are handled in a timely and effective manner, minimizing the impact on users and the platform.

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **First Responder (You, the AI Agent):** The first to detect or be notified of a potential incident. Responsible for initial assessment and escalation.
*   **Incident Commander:** The human engineer on call who is responsible for managing the incident response.

## 3. Incident Response Phases

### 3.1. Detection and Analysis

1.  **Detection:** Incidents can be detected through various channels, including:
    *   Monitoring and alerting systems.
    *   User reports.
    *   Internal testing.
2.  **Analysis:** As the First Responder, you must perform an initial analysis to determine the nature and severity of the incident. This includes:
    *   Gathering information from logs and other sources.
    *   Identifying the affected systems and users.
    *   Assessing the potential impact of the incident.

### 3.2. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

1.  **Containment:** The Incident Commander will determine the appropriate containment strategy to prevent the incident from spreading.
2.  **Eradication:** The root cause of the incident will be identified and eradicated.
3.  **Recovery:** The affected systems will be restored to their normal state.

### 3.3. Post-Incident Activity

1.  **Post-Mortem:** A post-mortem will be conducted to review the incident and identify lessons learned.
2.  **Documentation:** The incident will be documented in the incident response tracking system.

## 4. Incident Classification

Incidents will be classified based on their severity:

*   **Severity 1 (Critical):** A critical incident that has a widespread impact on users and the platform (e.g., data breach, system-wide outage).
*   **Severity 2 (High):** A high-impact incident that affects a significant number of users (e.g., a major feature is unavailable).
*   **Severity 3 (Medium):** A medium-impact incident that affects a limited number of users (e.g., a minor feature is not working as expected).
*   **Severity 4 (Low):** A low-impact incident that has a minimal impact on users (e.g., a cosmetic issue).

## 5. Escalation Procedures

As the First Responder, you must escalate all incidents to the Incident Commander immediately. You must provide the Incident Commander with all the information you have gathered during your initial analysis.
